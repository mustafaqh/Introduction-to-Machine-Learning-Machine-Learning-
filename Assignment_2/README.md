#  Assignment â€“ Feature Selection, ROC Analysis, and Classification

This assignment focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models using **custom implementations** of classification algorithms, **forward feature selection**, and **ROC-based performance metrics**.  
All models and evaluation logic are implemented from scratch using Python and NumPy.

##  Project Structure

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ mh224tb_A2.ipynb         # Main notebook demonstrating usage of models and evaluation
â”œâ”€â”€ MachineLearningModel.py  # Abstract ML model class + regression/logistic implementations
â”œâ”€â”€ ForwardSelection.py      # Greedy feature selection algorithm
â”œâ”€â”€ ROCAnalysis.py           # Precision, Recall, F1-score, TPR, FPR calculation
â”œâ”€â”€ DecisionBoundary.py      # Visualization of classification boundaries
```

-  Forward Feature Selection based on F-score
-  ROC analysis: TPR, FPR, Precision, Recall, F1-score
-  Custom model evaluation
-  Decision boundary visualization
-  Jupyter Notebook integration
