#  Assignment â€“ Advanced Classification Evaluation and Visualization

This assignment demonstrates **advanced evaluation of classification models** through ROC metrics, feature analysis, and decision boundary visualization.  
All models and metric calculations are done using custom Python implementations without external ML libraries.
