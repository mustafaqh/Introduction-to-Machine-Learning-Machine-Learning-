#  Assignment â€“ Logistic & Polynomial Regression from Scratch

This project contains implementations of **polynomial regression** and **logistic regression** from scratch using NumPy and basic Python, without using `scikit-learn`.  
It includes custom functions for cost calculation, prediction, feature transformation, and visualization.  
The assignment demonstrates how to handle both **regression** and **binary classification** problems.

##  Project Structure

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ exercise1.py           # Polynomial regression using gradient descent
â”œâ”€â”€ exercise2.py           # Logistic regression on microchip classification dataset
â”œâ”€â”€ exercise4.py           # Additional task (e.g., analysis or decision boundary)
â”œâ”€â”€ functions.py           # Shared helper functions
â”œâ”€â”€ microchips.csv         # Dataset for binary classification
â”œâ”€â”€ polynomial200.csv      # Dataset for polynomial regression
```

##  Implemented Techniques

- Polynomial feature transformation
- Logistic regression with gradient descent
- Sigmoid and cost functions (cross-entropy)
- Binary classification
- Manual gradient computation
- Visualization of decision boundaries
- Data loading and preprocessing from CSV

##  How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 and NumPy installed.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Run the exercises

Each file can be executed independently:

```bash
python exercise1.py
python exercise2.py
python exercise4.py
```

### 3. View Results

- Plots (e.g., regression curve or decision boundary) will open automatically
- Console output shows cost, accuracy, or classification results

---

##  Datasets

- `polynomial200.csv`: Used for polynomial regression  
- `microchips.csv`: Used for binary classification of microchip test results (likely `0 = Fail`, `1 = Pass`)

---

##  Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

To install the requirements:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
